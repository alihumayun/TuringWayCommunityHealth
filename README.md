# TuringWayCommunityHealth
This repository is to track the progress of my project, which is part of the Open Life Science Program.
## About
The project is to develop a community health report on the Turing Way project.
My project will attempt to take a systematic approach in understanding community practices, with the aim of continuing to grow and foster an inclusive environment for community members.
