# Tell us about your open life science project!

_Your project doesn't have to be technical — it can be a curriculum (open educational resource), an open data project or report, an open source software project, open publication, community/team culture movements, or anything else that:_

1. _supports openness in life science._
2. _has something to work on (a feature, module, or minimum viable product) during the program_
3. _allows and welcomes contributions by others_

_Whether your project is just an idea at this stage or something that's been running for years, all applications are welcome._

## Your project

**Project or Organization Name** :

_The Turing Way_ — Assessing community health and its impact on the wider data science community.

**Description of the project**

_max. 200 words_

In _The Turing Way,_ we want to systematically understand community practices including the community engagement pathways, contributors' roles and nature of their participation that have been successful at supporting its community of diverse contributors. Simultaneously, we want to identify factors that may currently prohibit short or long term commitments of our contributors and how they can be further supported.

With my participation in OLS-3, I will develop a community health report of the project, capturing community development aspects from growth to retention. I will build upon the Open Source community health metric ([https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community\_Health](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Health)), which involves evaluating contributors' group that is actively involved in a project, number of new contributors that join the project, and members who leave. For online projects, it can also involve tracking the number of community ambassadors, the number of return attendees to events and the rate of churned attendees. Developing an ideal metric in this project will require further deliberation and consultation from The Turing Way team and core contributors. Hence, this project will be collaboratively designed with other community members by actively inviting their contributions and thoughts.

**What problem(s) are you solving with this project?**

_max. 200 words_

_The Turing Way_ is an open source project that involves and supports a diverse community in developing and maintaining an online book to enable reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive data science worldwide. The proposed project will be an attempt to understand the effectiveness and impact of diversity and inclusion measures that currently exist within the project and what can be improved. This will help us make informed decisions to develop a more global approach that can ensure that the project is equitably accessible to contributors and users with a diverse skill-set, expertise and lived-experiences, particularly of those from underrepresented identities and backgrounds, and people with disability. This project will invite collaboration from community members to develop a meaningful metric for this project. Essentially, I believe this project would ensure that _The Turing Way_ does indeed remain open for everyone who intends to engage with the project or community.

**What concrete achievements do you want to accomplish during the program (Feb-May 2021)?**

In OLS-3, I have set the following goals for my project:

- collaborate with others in The Turing Way to gain a deeper understanding of this project and the Open Science communities in general.
- build some technical skills and become familiar with operating through GitHub.
- identify key issues that are currently impacting the community health of the wider data science community.
- develop some actionable recommendations/ideas for The Turing Way community.

**What is the current stage of your project or work?**

1. **I have a great idea**
2. Working towards a first prototype
3. Just launched first prototype
4. Working on new release / feature on existing prototype
5. Maintaining work on existing prototype

**Where would you like to be after the program (June 2021)?**

1. I have a great idea
2. Working towards a first prototype
3. **Just launched first prototype**
4. Working on new release / feature on existing prototype
5. Maintaining work on existing prototype

## Open Science

**What inspires you to work openly in life science?**

Alongside my studies, I have spent time volunteering as a teaching assistant. This experience really helped me develop my awareness of educational inequities. I have since been motivated to incorporate open research practices for improving access within my work. Similarly, I have been intrigued by research work that brings together qualitative and quantitative fields. This inspired me to undertake a Masters course in Digital Humanities, where I was able to combine the knowledge from my undergraduate history degree with an appreciation for programming skills. These experiences inspire me to work openly and use it as an opportunity to improve access to education by applying inclusive practices in my field to lower barriers to entry, particularly for those from underrepresented backgrounds. I am inspired by the ground-breaking research that is undertaken in open research projects, and I am keen to ensure that understanding of information and values from these projects are accessible to all, regardless of background or life experiences.

**What challenges have you faced in working in open science?**

I have not worked in open science before and I believe a partial reason for that is also the lack of diversity that has been present in the science community. Therefore, I also lacked an awareness of the field growing up and often felt that pursuing the field would not be an attainable goal for myself.

I am therefore keen to work in open science as well to help promote citizen science and decentralise access to it, in order to remove these preconceived notions about the field.

## Open Life Science program

**What are you hoping to learn during this program?**

I hope to deeply understand what it means to work &quot;openly&quot; and combine that with the opportunity to be in a position where I can help lead and sustain a meaningful contribution to _The Turing Way_ project. I am also hoping to be able to communicate with members across different projects in order to broaden my understanding of the Open Science community.

I have developed qualitative analytical skills through my studies in history and digital humanities. I have also grown strong communication skills and enjoy the act of learning through collaboration, particularly through studying and volunteering abroad in diverse teams. Ultimately, I believe I have developed more intangible, soft skills through my experiences and am eager to learn how I can apply them in the open sciences. Alongside this, I would also like to gain familiarity with the more technical aspect of the field, with the possibility of developing technical skills.

**What do you expect from a mentor?**

I hope to have the guidance from someone with experience in Open Science and community building, who can help me better understand the field so that I can bring those skills in _The Turing Way_ community while working on developing its community health report. I would be inviting more collaborators in the project, and any guidance in that direction will be useful. I would also appreciate just general career advice on how to utilise my skill set in the Open Science community and where I can add value. If possible, I would also appreciate resources on helping develop useful technical skills.

**Do you speak any languages other than English?**

I speak Urdu fluently and also have a very basic level of Italian.

**Accessibility:**

_The OLS team aims to create an inclusive environment as possible for everyone. To help us prepare effectively, please let us know if there anything we can do to facilitate your participation. This might include sign interpreters for video calls, alternative format materials, or something else. We will provide real-time captioning using otter.ai and/or Google Slides by default. This information will not be shared with application reviewers, and will not affect whether or not you are accepted to the program._
